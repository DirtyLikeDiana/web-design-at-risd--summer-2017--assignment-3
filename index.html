 <h1> Good Design is.... </h1>
   <div >
      <p>
         <select name="1">
           <option value=turtle>
          <h3>Innovative</h3>
               <option>The possibilities for progression are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for original designs. <br> But imaginative design always develops in tandem with improving technology, and can never be an end in itself.</option>

          </option>
         </select>
        <select name="2">
            <option value=turtle>
           <h3>Aesthetic</h3>
             <option>The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products are used every day and have an effect on people and their well-being. Only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</option>
           </option>
        </select>
                 <select name="3">
           <option value=turtle>
          <h3>Unobtrusive</h3>
               <option>Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression.</option>
          </option>
         </select>
        <select name="4">
            <option value=turtle>
           <h3>Honest</h3>
             <option>It does not make a product appear more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.</option>
           </option>
        </select>
               <select name="5">
           <option value=turtle>
          <h3>Long-Lasting</h3>
               <option>It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years — even in today’s throwaway society.</option>
          </option>
         </select>
        <select name="6">
            <option value=turtle>
           <h3>Thorough</h3>
             <option>down to the last detail. Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the consumer.</option>
           </option>
        </select>
               <select name="7">
           <option value=turtle>
          <h3>Environmentally Friendly</h3>
               <option>Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</option>
          </option>
         </select>
        <select name="8">
            <option value=turtle>
           <h3>As little design as possible </h3>
             <option>Less, but better — because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.</option>
           </option>
        </select>
               <select name="9">
           <option value=turtle>
          <h3>Makes a Product Useful</h3>
               <option>A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic criteria. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could detract from it.</option>
          </option>
         </select>
        <select name="10">
            <option value=turtle>
           <h3>Makes a product understandable </h3>
             <option>It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product clearly express its function by making use of the user’s intuition. At best, it is self-explanatory.
</option>
